# TreasureTags

## What is a TreasureTag?

TreasureTags ("Tags") are free gamertags that serve as your global player profile, identity, and the basis for user reputation across the Treasure gaming ecosystem. Your Tag is a "soulbound" (non-transferrable) digital collectible that will allow you to own your identity and will be required to participate in upcoming product releases including the future Proof of Play meta game (TreasureXP, Treasure Achieve, and Treasure Quests), among other experiences that may be accessible to only those who possess a Tag.

In the long term, your Tag can be linked to avatars to power up your social identity, earned badges to showcase your greatest achievements, and even benefit from cosmetic modifiers to alter the appearance of your Tag to stand out.&#x20;

The Tag is comprised of two parts: (1) a name; and (2) a discriminant (ie. 4-digit ending similar to Discord). Players will be limited to one Tag per wallet.

<summary>How do I get a TreasureTag?</summary>

You can mint your Tag [on Trove here](https://trove.treasure.lol/treasuretag). TreasureTags, at this time, are free to mint (beyond accompanying gas fees).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are TreasureTags unique?</summary>

Tags are semi-unique. There can be multiple people with the same name (so as to avoid users not being able to choose their own name or handle that they've used since childhood – a challenge we know very well as lifelong gamers) but the discriminant (the 4 numbers at the end) will need to be unique.\
\
For instance, there can be multiple users with the Tag name `karel` but there can only be one `karel#0001`. There can be a maximum of 10,000 `karel`'s in existence though as the discriminant will range from 0000-9999.

<summary>What types of characters are allowed in the Tag?</summary>

Only alphanumeric characters and hyphens are allowed in the Tag's name. Hyphens must be between characters and cannot be doubled up ("--") or at the start or end of the name.

<summary>Does my TreasureTag replace Smol Domains (.smol) and any .smol domains  that I own?</summary>

No, TreasureTag will be able to co-exist alongside [Smol Domains](https://www.smol.domains/) built by long-standing community member, Astro. If a user owns both a TreasureTag and .smol domain, it is planned to eventually allow users to select between showing the Tag or .smol domain. If a user only possesses a Tag, they will see the original treatment of the TreasureTag above with the red magic sparkle. If a user only possesses a .smol domain, they will see the text-based domain ending in .smol (eg. `gamer.smol`).
