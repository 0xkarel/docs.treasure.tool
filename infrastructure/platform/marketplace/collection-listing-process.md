# Collection Listing Process

In order to ease the onboarding for collections interested in being listing on Treasure, all collections will need to follow a standardized framework and process. Rather than reinvent the wheel, we will be leveraging best practices and standards followed by the majority of NFT marketplaces.

## Architectural Requirements

**As you build and design your collections, please ensure that you abide by:**

* the [Non-Fungible Token (ERC-721)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and [Multi Token (ERC-1155)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standards; and
* the [OpenSea Metadata Standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards) to design your metadata structure

For more details, see [metadata-support.md](metadata-support.md "mention").

## Listing Process

The below outlines the high-level process for listing on the Treasure:

1. Submit application via the [Game Partner Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe\_4Luv3wXGli-mR3GB-eOyjEU47r61qsjfDvBKISEggafz4Q/viewform)&#x20;
2. Review by the Treasure partnerships team
3. Discuss candidacy with prospective partner
4. Decision made to implement or reject

As a curated marketplace, not all partners will be accepted. Please see the [game-builders-program](../../../publishing/game-builders-program/ "mention") for more information

## Required Information

Once a game partner has been accepted to list their collection(s) on the Treasure marketplace, the following details are required:

* **Logistical Details:**
  * Requested launch timing
  * Contacts (Discord IDs)
* **Collection Details:**
  * Collection Name
  * Collection Description
  * Requested Collection URL Slug
  * Banner Image (1400x400 as a .jpg)

## Delisting Framework

For details regarding parameters that may result in a collection being delisted, please visit [delisting-framework.md](delisting-framework.md "mention").

## Permissionless / Open Listing Model

Treasure is currently a DAO-curated platform but there are plans to allow for an open and permissionless listing model down the road. No timeline is available for the time being.
