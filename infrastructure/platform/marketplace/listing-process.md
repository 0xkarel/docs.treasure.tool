# Listing Process

In order to ease the onboarding for collections interested in being listing on Treasure, all collections will need to follow a standardized framework and process. Rather than reinvent the wheel, we will be leveraging best practices and standards followed by the majority of NFT marketplaces.

## Architectural Requirements

**As you build and design your collections, please ensure that you abide by:**

* the [Non-Fungible Token (ERC-721)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and [Multi Token (ERC-1155)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standards; and
* the [OpenSea Metadata Standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards) to design your metadata structure

For more details, see [Broken link](broken-reference "mention").

## Listing Process

The below outlines the high-level process for listing on the Treasure. The timeline from start to finish is estimated at 1-2 weeks prior to the selection of a launch date as part of a cohort-based launch and is contingent on the volume of submissions.

1. Submit application via the [Partnership Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScd\_G8RCJwTlk2SwN4hUnAX1lAYmK0O3HJgijkH5sYeKhl0Rg/viewform)
2. Review by the Trove Council
3. Decision made to provide feedback and/or implementation

To list on Trove in $MAGIC, please see the [Ecosystem Integration Framework](https://docs.treasure.lol/partnerships/ecosystem-integration-framework) as this follows a different process.

## Required Information

Once a collection has been accepted into a cohort to launch on Trove, the following details are required:

* **Logistical Details:**
  * Requested launch timing
  * Contacts (Discord IDs)
* **Collection Details:**
  * Collection Name
  * Collection Description
  * Requested Collection URL Slug
  * Banner Image (1400x400 as a .jpg)
  * Thumbnail image (600x600 as a .jpg)
  * Links (if applicable):
    * Discord

  * Testnet Contract

  * Main Project Name (i.e. to group related collections together)

## Delisting Framework

For details regarding parameters that may result in a collection being delisted, please visit [Broken link](broken-reference "mention").

## Permissionless / Open Listing Model

Treasure is currently a DAO-curated platform but there are plans to allow for an open and permissionless listing model down the road.
