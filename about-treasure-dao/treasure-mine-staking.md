# Treasure Mine (Staking)

## What is staking?

Staking is the process of locking up your holdings (whether that be $MAGIC and/or your NFTs) in order to obtain rewards or earn interest.&#x20;

## What can I stake?

Following the migration to Arbitrum, you can stake 3 things on Treasure:

* $MAGIC in the Genesis Mine
* Treasures in the Treasure Mine
* SLP tokens in the MAGIC-WETH SLP

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Note:** Staking is no longer active on the Ethereum Mainnet, and **** you can no longer stake Loot, n, or AGLD for MAGIC.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In some of the integrated projects, you can also stake the following:

* [smolverse](../partnerships/partnership-intergrations/smolverse/ "mention")
