# Diamond Integration

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Treasure\_Tier\_Badge\_Diamond\_AW\_100px.png)\


The Diamond tier is targeted at high potential, aligned teams who will greatly benefit from Treasure’s end-to-end advisory and support to supercharge adoption and growth.

Within this tier, Treasure provides support across and access to a powerful network of industry experts and partners across the game development value chain, such as Technical (incl. Arbitrum team support), strategy, game design / economy, community building and operations, go-to market (incl. strategy, content creators, distribution - extensive partner networks, amplification - including Arbitrum and activation - events / esports) and funding (incl. mint, raise and network leads). Games may also leverage Treasure’s preferred partner status for cheaper SaaS.

There will be limited positions available in each cohort. This is to ensure Treasure can maintain a high level of advisory and support for its highest potential partners.

The assessment will be conducted by the Games Builder Council and recommended to our independent gaming industry expert, [Noisewar:](https://twitter.com/warandnoise)

* Games consultant, former EA and Nexon Mobile, 14 years experience in online service games, monetization, and full-cycle 1st and 3rd party product management.

Noisewar’s review will inform whether an offer is presented to successful candidates.\
