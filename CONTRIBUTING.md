# Introduction

## What is Treasure?

Treasure began as a free-to-mint Loot derivative that included 8 "Treasures" per NFT. The project, lead by John Patten, has since evolved into TreasureDAO, which aims to create a giga-verse based on the interaction between two resources - Treasures and $MAGIC. TreasureDAO and $MAGIC's goals are to be bridges between metaverses, becoming the base layer of disparate universes, powering and connecting them. $MAGIC is to be the reserve currency of the metaverse, fueling the ecosystem and making its resources productive!What is the point of Treasure?
