## Introduction

Treasure offers a collection of modular on-chain features and engaging game loops designed to empower game developers. By seamlessly connecting their games to Treasure's tooling, developers can leverage on-chain game features as if they were native to their projects, streamlining the development process and accelerating time to market.

## Key Features

We offer a comprehensive development kit of interconnected on-chain game loops and features that can be easily plugged into your game. This modular design enables developers to choose the functionalities that best suit their game, while providing a seamless integration experience. We currently offer the following infrastructure functionalities for games and dApps:

* **Creating and managing guilds**: Build and oversee player communities, establish hierarchies, and set up communication channels.
* **Facilitating in-game commerce/payments**: Enable secure and seamless in-game payments, including trading, buying, and selling virtual goods or services.
* **Asset emissions**: Efficiently generate, distribute, and manage in-game assets, such as items, currencies, or resources.

## Benefits

Comprehensive documentation and code samples further support developers in leveraging the tool's capabilities to their fullest potential.

## Who is this for?

1. **Game Builders**: It's a perfect tool for those seeking to craft unique, engaging gaming experiences. We provide on-chain game features, simplifying the development process. This allows creators to focus more on innovative gameplay. It caters to both independent developers and larger game studios, helping them create standout games.
2. **Treasure Ecosystem Partners**: As a vital part of the Treasure ecosystem, our game development suite integrates effortlessly with various network games and applications. Partners can enjoy improved collaboration, shared game loops, and cross-game interactions. By using this, they can help foster a vibrant community of interconnected games and applications, enhancing user experiences.

## Architecture

Our game development suite's architecture is designed to be a universal contract for all games, divided into modules with distinct functions. It allows third-party developers to customize according to their needs. This on-chain component, managed and updated by Treasure, uses a [Diamond](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) contract that can be upgraded, ensuring our suite can evolve and accommodate new on-chain demands. This saves third-party developers the hassle of modifying their code for new features.

However, an upgradable contract might disrupt existing integrations - if a function Contract A relies on is removed, transactions through Contract A could fail. To prevent this, Treasure will only add to the core contract, maintaining backwards compatibility.

## Getting Started

Our tooling operates on the concept of 'Organizations,' where each Organization symbolizes a game. To start working with our game development suite on either the testnet or mainnet, you'll need to establish an Organization for your project.&#x20;
