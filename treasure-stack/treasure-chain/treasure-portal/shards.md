# 🟪 Shards

With the launch of Treasure Ruby, we’ve dropped new accompanying quests and a points system called “Shards” that can be collected on the road to the full Treasure Chain launch.&#x20;

Shards are separate from Gems, and will be used to inform future rewards and incentives for early adopters of the chain. Earn Shards by participating in a series of quests on the Portal to discover the Treasure Chain and its features! New quests will be added in upcoming weeks and throughout testnet.
