# ðŸš° Portal Faucet

## What is the Faucet?

The Faucet in the Treasure Portal is a feature that allows developers and users to request and receive testnet MAGIC tokens. These tokens are used for testing purposes within the Treasure ecosystem, such as in applications or smart contracts, without using real funds.

### Pre-Requirements:

Before you can use the Faucet, you'll need a compatible wallet that supports testnet MAGIC tokens. For this guide, we'll use Metamask as an example.&#x20;

### Collecting from the Faucet:

1. **Connect Your Wallet:**
   * Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top-right corner of the Treasure Portal.
   * Follow the prompts to connect your Metamask wallet or another compatible wallet.

2. **Request Tokens:**

* Navigate to the "Faucet" section from the sidebar menu.
* (optional, only if you wish to send to a different wallet) In the "Send to" field, enter the wallet address you wish to send the testnet MAGIC to.
* Note that there is a limit to how much you can request per day, which is usually stated next to the input field.

3. **Pass the Security Check:**

* Complete the reCAPTCHA or any other security verification that appears to prove you are not a bot.

4. **Mint and Transfer Funds:**

* Once the security check is complete, the "Deposit 5 MAGIC" button will become clickable.
* Click this button to initiate the minting and transfer of testnet MAGIC tokens to your specified wallet address.

### Verifying Your Transaction:

1. **Transaction List:**
   * After completing the token request, look for your transaction in the "Recent Transactions (Treasure Ruby)" section to confirm it went through.
2. **Block Explorer:**
   * You can also use a testnet block explorer to verify the transaction details. You'll need the transaction hash, which can usually be copied from the transaction list or your wallet history.
3. **Wallet Summary:**
   * Check your wallet's HUD (Heads-Up Display) or main menu to see an updated balance of how many testnet MAGIC tokens you have received.

Using the Faucet is an essential part of testing on the Treasure testnet, ensuring you have the necessary tokens to explore and interact with the platform's features. Remember that testnet tokens have no real-world value and are meant solely for testing purposes.
