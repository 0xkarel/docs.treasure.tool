# üñºÔ∏è Commemorative NFT

### Pre-Requirements:

Before minting an NFT, ensure you have enough MAGIC in your wallet to cover gas fees. If not, collect more from the [Faucet](../../portal-faucet.md).&#x20;

### Step-by-Step Minting Process:

1. **Navigate to Minting Page:**
   * Go to the provided [link](https://testnet.treasurescan.io/address/0x76C3b527B711A3B6aA01e4f76EC34b41a671cA29) to access the NFT minting in our block explorer.&#x20;
2. **Connect Your Wallet:**
   * Click the 'Connect Wallet' button on the page.
   * Choose your wallet from the compatible options and log in.

4. **Mint Your NFT:**
   * Scroll to the section labeled "mint."
   * Click to expand the menu and select the 'Write' button to initiate the minting process.
5. **Network Switch (If Necessary):**
   * If prompted, switch networks to the one required for the NFT minting process. Your wallet may automatically prompt you to switch, or you may need to do this manually within the wallet settings.
6. **Approve Transactions:**
   * Confirm and approve all contract interactions and payment requirements that pop up in your wallet to mint the NFT.
