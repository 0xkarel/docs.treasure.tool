## The Origin of Gems

Gems are a naturally occurring resource that players can earn by completing quests and bounties, as well as achieving impressive feats like topping the leaderboards or winning tournaments.

As a result of their shiny exterior, sapphire hue, and other reasons unknown, they are highly coveted by [Meem](https://x.com/meemtreasure), a recurring character within the Treasure universe known for his entrepreneurial endeavors as The Wandering Merchant.

In his pursuit to obtain as many Gems as possible, Meem has assembled Treasure Chests filled with items he's found on his adventures throughout Bridgeworld with the hopes of exchanging these for the precious blue crystals.&#x20;
