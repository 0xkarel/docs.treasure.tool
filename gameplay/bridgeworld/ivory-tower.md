# Ivory Tower

The Ivory Tower is where Legions can set out on quests in search of Treasures and other items, growing more experienced as they continue to explore Bridgeworldâ€™s frontiers. Questing points are awarded per completed quests, and these are used to automatically gain questing levels.

**How many Questing Points are required per level?**&#x20;

In Season 1, Legions will have a maximum of 5 Questing Levels. Increasing their QP unlocks more difficult quests, which then offer players better rewards. Questing experience and in turn, levels are automatically awarded for each successful quest completion (see below).

**How many quests are there?**&#x20;

Initially, there are three tiers of quests: Easy, Medium and Hard.&#x20;

**Do I need to pay MAGIC to go on a quest?**

No. There is no MAGIC cost associated with questing.&#x20;

**Is there an auto-quest feature?**

Yes! You can stake Balancer Crystals to have the game automate questing for you.&#x20;

1. Harder quests require more Balancer Crystals staked to activate the auto-quest feature.&#x20;
2. The Balancer Crystals requirements are per legion, not per wallet.&#x20;
3. Balancer Crystals tokens are locked for the duration of the auto-quest.

![Note. This requirement is per legion. If you want to send two legions on easy 3 auto-questing loops, you will need to stake and lock 5 x 2 = 10 Balancer Crystals.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)
