# The Forge

The Forge is where Legions can utilize Treasures to craft powerful consumables. Treasures contain magical properties that Legions can extract and use to craft valuable consumables, growing more experienced as they continue to hone their trade.

### **How many Crafting Points are required per level?**&#x20;

In Season 1, Legions will have a maximum of 5 Crafting Levels. Increasing Legions’ CP enables them to craft more difficult recipes. Crafting experience and, in turn, levels are automatically awarded for each successful craft completion (see below).

### **Is there an auto-craft feature?**&#x20;

There is no auto-craft feature.

### **How many Recipes are there?**&#x20;

Initially, there are three tiers of recipes: Easy, Medium and Hard. In Season 1, these recipes will produce three types of productive consumables (see below).

### **What are the ingredients needed for each Recipe?**

Various recipes will require a number of different Treasures as ingredients (see below). For example, for an easy recipe, you will need to prepare 2 x T5 Treasures and 1 x T4 Treasure.

### **Do Treasures have unlimited uses?**

When crafting, Treasures have a chance of breaking. Broken Treasures are sent to the World Treasury, where they will be recycled and re-distributed as reward for Quests.&#x20;

With the exception of Grin and Honeycomb, Treasures’ likelihood of breaking are based on their Tier. Treasures break during the process required to extract and apply the Magic at their core to Legions' craft.  Legions who break a Grin or Honeycomb report feeling a tremor that shakes the very foundation of Bridgeworld, an Essence of Grin or Honeycomb in the debris.

### **How does crafting success rate interact with Treasures’ break chance?**&#x20;

**If your crafting is successful**, 100% of the MAGIC cost is consumed. Additionally, all the Treasures used in the recipe have a chance of breaking. For example: For an easy recipe

* The ingredients required are 1 x T4 Treasures and 2 x T5 Treasures
* T5 has a 18.10% chance to break and T4 has a 11.29% chance to break
* If your craft succeeds (90% chance), the RNG is run against each of the Treasure. If the RNG hits the corresponding threshold probability, your Treasure breaks and is burned. This is repeated for each of the Treasures.

**If your crafting fails**, you will be refunded 90% of the MAGIC required for the recipe, and nothing will happen to your Treasures.&#x20;
