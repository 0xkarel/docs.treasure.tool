# The Harvesters

Harvesters compete for MAGIC emissions amongst each other and the Atlas Mine. While Harvesters have a capped AUM of 10M MAGIC each in Season 1, their potential Mining Power and relative share of overall emissions can exceed the Atlas Mine due to an incremental boost derived from the number of Harvester Parts and the number and rarity of Legions staked.&#x20;

### Harvester Boost

Harvesters can have their emissions boosted beyond the Atlas Mine by:

1. adding more Harvester Parts
2. staking more Legions
3. staking Legions that have higher rarities/rank.

Both Harvester Parts and Legion boosts have diminishing returns as you stake more (they are quadratic). This mechanism is designed to balance the overall meta, and ensure that no guild gets too far ahead with just one strategy.

The incremental Harvester boost does not include Treasure and Consumables deposited.

### Calculating Harvester and Individual share of emissions

A Harvester’s share of emissions is calculated by their total mining power (including Harvester Boosts) as a proportion of the total Mining Power across all Harvesters and the Atlas Mine.

An individual’s share of emissions (their Mining Power) within a Harvester is based on the amount of MAGIC staked in the harvester, multiplied by the sum of the boosts obtained by the time locked MAGIC, staking Legions and Treasures alongside their MAGIC deposit. MAGIC rewards received are simply the individual’s share of the total Mining Power in the harvester after accounting for everyone’s boosts.

Different Legions and Treasures have different boosts, with rare items having larger effects. These items can be stacked and are capped. All boosts are additive, not multiplicative as per the equation above.
