# Pilgrimage

Pilgrimage is where pre-Bridgeworld Legions go to obtain properties required to participate in the Bridgeworld game. All existing common Genesis and Auxiliary Legions are **automatically assigned** one of five classes (Siege, Fighter, Assassin, Ranged and Spellcaster). The existing Uncommon, Rare and Legendary Legions will not have to select a class. All newly summoned Legions will have a predetermined class and are not required to use the Pilgrimage function.

### **Does Pilgrimage influence the rarity of my Legion?**

The pilgrimage process does not upgrade the rarity of your Legions. For example, a common Genesis Legion, through the pilgrimage process, emerges as a common Genesis Assassin.
