# Barracks

The Barrack is where players can summon a “Recruit” legion to explore the game. Recruits can be minted for 10 MAGIC, and have multiple restrictions relative to normal Legions. These are:

* Cannot summon or gain questing/crafting experience points/levels
* Cannot upgrade to a common legion
* Cannot be burned and/or transferred to another wallet
* Can only do a Recruit-specific Quest (see below)

Recruits allow new players a low-cost route of entry into the game which does not adversely impact the broader economy, since they are noninflationary in nature to the Legion population. They are nonetheless not to be underestimated, since their ability to earn material rewards from even a basic quest provides a route for new players to save and earn their own legion over time.
