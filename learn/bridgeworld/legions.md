# Legions

Legions (NFTs) are the physical entities of the Bridgeworld, borne through spontaneous cracks and expanding entropies of the Bridgeworld.

Players take control of Legions and Mine, Farm, Craft, Quest, Battle, and more to propagate and build the Bridgeworld together.

There are two generations of Legions: (1) Genesis (Gen0) and (2) Non-genesis (Gen1).
