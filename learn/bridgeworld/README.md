## About Bridgeworld

Bridgeworld is the flagship product of Treasure.

In Bridgeworld, players take control of Legions and Mine, Farm, Craft, Quest, Battle, and more to propagate and build the Bridgeworld together.

**Functions in the works for Bridgeworld (subject to change):**

* **Stake/Mine:** Time-locked mechanism to mine $MAGIC. Progressively harder based on â€˜Proof of Work'.
* **LP:** Different aspects of liquidity provision are abstracted to the gameplay and large economic mechanics.
* **Trade:** Marketplace where users can trade Treasure-curated collections on Arbitrum.
