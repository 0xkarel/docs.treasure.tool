## The Migration&#x20;

The first rays of the morning sun streamed over the horizon as the dawn came, bathing the mist on the water in a mild orange hue.

She opened her eyes. The sound of the surrounding water lapping against the side of the boat gradually registered in her consciousness.

_“Where am I?”, she wondered._

_“In fact, WHO am I?”_

This journey, on this boat — yes, it certainly was a boat, crossing some sort of lake, or river. It wasn’t clear to her. She turned to look around and saw dozens of others huddled up in blankets.

_“Well, at least we’re all comfortable here. But where are we going?”_

Behind her, she looked up and saw a tall figure in the shadows, rowing the boat in the pale light of dawn. Cloaked in a dark hood, he stared out into the horizon, ceaselessly rowing, ever watchful.

_The Riverman._

How did she know that name? It was a strange feeling, as if she had only just come to exist, with barely a memory of what came before. But at the same time, it was evident that she had a past. Little girls don’t _simply_ come into existence, they grow up and go to school and have friends. Friends and family.

_Family._

Where was her family? She couldn’t even remember her name. Everyone has a name, surely. It was all very unclear.

As the mist began to clear with the approaching sunrise, her fellow passengers started to stir. As she tried to sit up, she noticed something tied to her wrist: a little purple velvet pouch, with some words embroidered on it.

_“For my dearest Aliya, a safe journey to a better world.”_

Aliya. That was her name. Was it? She couldn’t be sure, but at that point that was all she had to go with. Who gave her that pouch? What was in it?

She unfastened the strings and took a look inside: there were some golden coins, a couple of red tokens, a red feather, a chunk of honeycomb and a queer looking relic.

_“Ah, grandma, always obsessed with these little trinkets”, she mused._

Grandma? Yes, that made sense. Only grandmothers give away embroidered gifts. Where was the rest of her family? She wasn’t alone, but as she turned to look around, everyone else on the boat looked familiar but foreign at the same time.

And as they looked back at her, she could see in their eyes the same bewilderment.

_It was as if they all knew that they had a history, but it was a past that they could barely remember._

“We’re almost there now”, the Riverman announced.

As the mist cleared, Aliya looked out across the water and saw hundreds of other boats around her. Ahead of them was a landscape adorned with mountains and green pastures.

_“Everyone’s surprisingly calm for a bunch of people who seem to have lost their memories”, thought Aliya to herself._

“Everything will be made clear in time, little one”, the Riverman said to her.

But all the pondering left Aliya exhausted, and she dozed off in the cool morning breeze.
