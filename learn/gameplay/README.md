## How Bridgeworld Works

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**MAGIC**</mark> powers everything | <mark style="color:red;">**TREASURES**</mark> as resources | <mark style="color:red;">**LEGIONS**</mark> required to play |
{% endhint %}

### Magic

MAGIC is the natural resource of the Treasure metaverse, which “powers on” NFTs and turns them from fantasy into productive, yield-bearing assets. MAGIC is designed to be increasingly scarce. Players can earn $MAGIC through participating in Bridgeworld.&#x20;

### Legions

Legions (NFTs) are the physical entities of the Bridgeworld, borne through spontaneous cracks and expanding entropies of the Bridgeworld. There are two generations of Legions: Gen0 and Gen1

### Treasures

Treasures (NFTs) are a set of economic resources shared across the metaverse. As such, each Treasure carries a unique story that weaves different worlds together. Players will be able to use Treasures to craft consumables or burn them for special effects.

### Consumables

Consumables play a critical role in Bridgeworld. They highlight the notion of composability cross-metaverse and are key inputs into game mechanics. In the first iteration,  players can use Legions and Treasures to create harvester parts and mining equipment (e.g., mining drills).&#x20;

## Functions in Bridgeworld (subject to change):

### Trading

Marketplace where users can trade Treasure-curated collections on Arbitrum.

### Liquidity Pool

Different aspects of liquidity provision are abstracted to the game-play and economic mechanics.

### Mining

Time-locked mechanism to mine $MAGIC. Progressively harder based on ‘Proof of Work'.
