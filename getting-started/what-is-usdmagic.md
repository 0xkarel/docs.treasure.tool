# What is $MAGIC?

MAGIC is the natural resource of the Treasure metaverse, which “powers on” NFTs and turns them from fantasy into productive, yield-bearing assets.

MAGIC is designed to be increasingly scarce (emissions declining as complexity of the economy increases), as it weaves an ever-growing web of narrative bridges within the Metaverse.

Players can earn $MAGIC through playing, mining and participating in Bridgeworld. The Treasure ecosystem, therefore, is governed by MAGIC holders.
