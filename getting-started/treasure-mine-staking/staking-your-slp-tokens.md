{% hint style="danger" %}
Please ensure to read through [how bonds work including the pricing mechanisms](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro/olympus-pro-users/other-frequently-asked-questions#how-is-the-bond-price-discount-determined). A negative ROI suggests you should wait until demand subsidies (unless you feel generous and would like to give the DAO cheap LP). The discount rate will dynamically adjust.&#x20;
