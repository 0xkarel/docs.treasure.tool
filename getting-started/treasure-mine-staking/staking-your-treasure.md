# Staking Your Treasure

## How are the point distributions for the Treasure Mine calculated?

Your deposited points, divided by total points deposited, equals your share of emissions.

To see the point distributions, please refer to [treasures.md](../treasures.md "mention").

## Why are MAGIC emissions for Treasures so low?

Treasures do not start and end at the Genesis Mine. We have way bigger things in store for Treasures so feel free to earn some extra $MAGIC in the meantime!

## Can I stake my original, unravelled Treasure cards that are on the Ethereum Mainnet?

No. You will have to wait until there is another migration where they will be ported to Arbitrum.
