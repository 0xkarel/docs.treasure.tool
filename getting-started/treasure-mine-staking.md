# Staking $MAIC

## What is staking?

Staking is the process of locking up your holdings (whether that be $MAGIC and/or your NFTs) in order to obtain rewards or earn interest.

## What can I stake?

Following the migration to Arbitrum, you can stake 2 things on Treasure:

* $MAGIC in the Atlas Mine in Bridgeworld
* SLP tokens in the MAGIC-WETH SLP

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Note:** Staking is no longer active on the Ethereum Mainnet, and you can no longer stake Loot, n, or AGLD for MAGIC.
{% endhint %}

## How can I stake?

You can stake $MAGIC in other tokens in the Bridgeworld Atlas Mine. For more details, please see[magic-mining](../bridgeworld/bridgeworld-litepaper/magic-mining/ "mention").
