# Bridgeworld and Legions

## About Bridgeworld

Bridgeworld is the flagship product of Treasure.

Bridgeworld, or Legions, as they are represented by is an undercurrent world beneath the undulating waves of other worlds. Unseen, independent, but ever-present.

In Bridgeworld, players are the soul and Legions are the bodies fallen from myriads of other worlds. Players take control of Legions and Mine, Farm, Craft, Quest, Battle, and more to propagate and build the Bridgeworld together.

**Functions in the works for Bridgeworld (subject to change):**

* **Stake/Mine:** Time-locked mechanism to mine $MAGIC. Progressively harder based on â€˜Proof of Work'.
* **LP:** Different aspects of liquidity provision are abstracted to the gameplay and large economic mechanics.
* **Trade:** Marketplace where users can trade Treasure-curated collections on Arbitrum.

## About Legions

Legions (NFTs) are the physical entities of the Bridgeworld, borne through spontaneous cracks and expanding entropies of the Bridgeworld.

Players take control of Legions and Mine, Farm, Craft, Quest, Battle, and more to propagate and build the Bridgeworld together.

There are four different types of Legions:

* [genesis-gen0.md](../bridgeworld-and-legions/genesis-gen0.md "mention")
* [non-genesis-gen1.md](../bridgeworld-and-legions/non-genesis-gen1.md "mention")
