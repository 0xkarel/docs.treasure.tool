# Migrating Treasures to Arbitrum

As of December 9, 2021, there is no active migration for Treasure Bags (8x fractions) and individual fractions on L1 to L@.

Future migrations may take place but, for now, the window to migrate has been closed for the time being.

There were previously two migration windows:

* **Migration #1:** October 6, 2021 at 10:42pm to October 26, 2021 at 3:00am UTC
* **Migration #2:** December 1, 2021 at 3:00am to December 9, 2021 at 3:00am UTC

## Claiming Treasures from Migration #2

_(Note: This guide is only applicable to you if you were part of the second migration window that took place between December 1-9, 2021)_

**1. First, ensure you're on the Arbiturm network and have some ETH (this should cost you around \~0.0017 ETH).**&#x20;

**Navigate to the** [**Treasure Mine**](https://mine.treasure.lol) **and click the "Claim" button beside the "Genesis" heading.**&#x20;

**5. You should now see a list of NFTs that you are eligible to claim. You will need to claim each NFT individually (there's currently no way to claim them all at once).**&#x20;

Each claim will incur a small transaction fee.
