# Bridging Back to Mainnet

**How do I bridge ETH back from Arbitrum to mainnet?**

You can use the same bridge **** you used to bridge ETH from Mainnet to Arbitrum ([https://bridge.arbitrum.io/](https://bridge.arbitrum.io)) but it will take about a week for your ETH to get back to Mainnet.&#x20;

A recommendation is to use Synapse ([https://synapseprotocol.com/](https://synapseprotocol.com)) as it has been tested by a large amount of members here
