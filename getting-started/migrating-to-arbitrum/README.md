_This tutorial assumes you have already downloaded a Web3 wallet like_ [_MetaMask_](https://metamask.io) _and that you have Ether or a token in that wallet on the Ethereum Mainnet._

The steps below assume you are using MetaMask as your wallet.

## 1. Add the Arbitrum Network

On desktop, you can add the Arbitrum Network in two ways:

1.  Clicking a single button on [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io)

    1. Ensure you are first logged in to a wallet
    2. Once you're logged in, click "Add L2 Network" in the top right corner and click "Switch network" in the popup that appears

2. Manually by following these steps:
   1. Click on the MetaMask extension
   2.  Click on “Ethereum Mainnet” network at the top -> click on “Add Network” at the bottom of the menu, and enter the following in the tab that appears:

       **Network Name:** Arbitrum\
       **RPC:** https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc\
       **Chain ID:** 42161\
       **Currency Symbol:** ETH\
       **Block Explorer URL:** https://arbiscan.io

## 2. Bridge Your ETH

{% hint style="info" %}
Be sure to bridge additional ETH to allow for you to pay for transactions on Arbitrum. Like L1, this still costs ETH. However, it costs significantly less as most transactions are between 0.003 and 0.009.
{% endhint %}
