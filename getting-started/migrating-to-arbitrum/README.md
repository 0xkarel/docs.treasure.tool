The steps below assume you are using MetaMask as your wallet.

## 1. Add the Arbitrum Network

On desktop, you can add the Arbitrum Network in two ways:

1.  Clicking a single button on [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io)

    1. Ensure you are first logged in to a wallet
    2. Once you're logged in, click "Add L2 Network" in the top right corner and click "Switch network" in the popup that appears

## 2. Bridge Your ETH

{% hint style="info" %}
Be sure to bridge additional ETH to allow for you to pay for transactions on Arbitrum. Like L1, this still costs ETH. However, it costs significantly less as most transactions are between 0.003 and 0.009.
{% endhint %}
