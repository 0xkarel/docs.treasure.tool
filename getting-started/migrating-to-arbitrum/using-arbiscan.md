# Using Arbiscan

Like Etherscan, Arbiscan is the block explorer and analytics platform for Arbitrum.

Arbiscan allows you to view data regarding any pending or confirmed transaction that has taken place on Arbitrum.

Assuming you're using MetaMask, you can access it by:

1. Clicking on the MetaMask icon in your browser toolbar;
2. Navigating to the account you want to explore;
3. Clicking the three dots in the top right;
4. Clicking on "View Account in Explorer"

Alternatively, you can copy and paste the following URL into your browser and add your wallet's public address to the end: [https://arbiscan.io/address/](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7A6a48b8e7BD3451Fc57f01Ad9Aaea62cdf5956E)

An example with a wallet address included: [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x174Aa380B3a45D54B502406e94a864d2849aC16A](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x174Aa380B3a45D54B502406e94a864d2849aC16A)
