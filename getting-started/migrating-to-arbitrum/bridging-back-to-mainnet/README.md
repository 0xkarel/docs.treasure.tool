# Bridging Back to Mainnet

## **How do I bridge ETH back from Arbitrum to mainnet?**

You can use the same bridge \*\*\*\* that you used to bridge ETH from Mainnet to Arbitrum ([https://bridge.arbitrum.io/](https://bridge.arbitrum.io)). Please note that it will take approximately 7 days for your ETH to get back to Mainnet.

You can also use Synapse ([https://synapseprotocol.com/](https://synapseprotocol.com)) which has been tested by a large number of members of the Treasure community.
