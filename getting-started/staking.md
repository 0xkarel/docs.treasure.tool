# Staking

## What is staking?

Staking is the process of locking up your holdings (whether that be $MAGIC or your NFTs) in order to obtain rewards or earn interest.&#x20;

## What can I stake?

Following the migration to Arbitrum, you can stake 3 things on Treasure:

* $MAGIC in the Genesis Mine
* Treasures in the Treasure Mine
* SLP tokens in the MAGIC-WETH SLP

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Note:** Staking is no longer active on the Ethereum Mainnet **and** you can no longer stake Loot, n, AGLD for MAGIC.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In some of the integrated projects, you can also stake the following:

## Genesis Mine

### How do I stake my $MAGIC in the Genesis Mine?

You can stake your $MAGIC at [mine.treasure.lol](https://https/mine.treasure.lol) in the **Genesis Mine** which will run until the 25th of January.

### What are the lockup options?

1. 2 week lockup - 120% boosted mining efficiency
2. 1 month lockup - 150% boosted mining efficiency

Note: this is not a return, it is a multiplier on the $MAGIC that you have deposited (i.e. if you deposited 100 $MAGIC, you would receive emissions as if you deposited 150 $MAGIC).

### Can I mix and match the Genesis Mine MAGIC lockup?

Yes. You can lock some up for 1 month and some for two weeks at the same time. You can also claim your rewards at any point and lock those as well.

## Treasure Staking

### How are the point distributions for the Treasure Mine calculated?

Your deposited points, divided by total points deposited, equals your share of emissions.

To see the point distributions, please refer to [treasures.md](what-is-usdmagic/treasures.md "mention").

### Why are MAGIC emissions for Treasures so low?

Treasures do not start and end at the Genesis Mine. We have way bigger things in store for Treasures so feel free to earn some extra $MAGIC in the meantime!

### Can I stake my original, unravelled Treasure cards that are on the Ethereum Mainnet?

No. You will have to wait until there is another migration where they will be ported to Arbitrum.

## SLP Staking

Please refer to [liquidity-pool.md](liquidity-pool.md "mention") for more details

## Other

### Can I still stake Loot, n, AGLD for $MAGIC?

No, that phase is over.

### How do I stake my Legion cards?

Legions are not available to stake yet. Details will be announced in time.
