# Bridgeworld and Legions

## About Bridgeworld

Bridgeworld is the flagship product of Treasure.

Bridgeworld, represented in practical terms by Legions, is an undercurrent running beneath the undulating waves of other worlds. Unseen, independent, but ever-present

In Bridgeworld, players are the soul and Legions are the bodies fallen from a myriad of other worlds. Players take control of Legions in order to Mine, Farm, Craft, Quest, Battle, and more. By doing so, they propagate and build the Bridgeworld together.

**Functions in the works for Bridgeworld (subject to change):**

* **Stake/Mine:** Time-locked mechanism to mine $MAGIC. Progressively harder based on "Proof of Work."
* **LP:** Different aspects of liquidity provision are abstracted to the gameplay and large economic mechanics.
* **Trade:** Marketplace where users can trade Treasure-curated collections on Arbitrum.

## About Legions

Legions (NFTs) are the physical entities of the Bridgeworld, borne through the spontaneous cracks and expanding entropies of the Bridgeworld.



Players take control of Legions in order to Mine, Farm, Craft, Quest, Battle, and more. By doing so, they propagate and build the Bridgeworld together.

Players take control of Legions and Mine, Farm, Craft, Quest, Battle, and more to propagate and build the Bridgeworld together.
