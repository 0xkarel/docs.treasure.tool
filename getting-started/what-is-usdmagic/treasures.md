# Treasures

## What are treasures?

Treasures (NFTs) are a set of economic resources shared across the metaverse. As such, each Treasure carries a unique story that weaves different worlds.

They are lore of other worlds, and they, themselves are the bridges between them.

Players will be able to use Treasures to craft consumables or burn them for special effects
