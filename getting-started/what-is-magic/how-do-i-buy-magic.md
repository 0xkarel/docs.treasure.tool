# How do I buy $MAGIC?

ðŸŽ¥ **For a video walkthrough,** [**please see this link**](https://twitter.com/rheger7/status/1478466956718182406?s=20)**.**

First, make sure you're on Arbitrum (not L1 / Ethereum Mainnet) because this is where all of the magic happens (no pun intended) and where the Treasure ecosystem is currently being built out.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Please note:** $MAGIC is also available on L1 via Uniswap so please be mindful of the network you're buying $MAGIC on. Any $MAGIC you own can be bridged over onto Arbitrum.
{% endhint %}

## 1. Move ETH over onto Arbitrum.

If you already have some ETH on L1 / Ethereum Mainnet, please see the [Steps to Migrate to Arbitrum](https://docs.treasure.lol/getting-started/migrating-to-arbitrum#steps-to-migrate-to-arbitrum) guide (which uses MetaMask as an example).

You can also buy ETH on Arbitrum directly on exchanges like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com), and [FTX](https://ftx.com).

## 2. Purchase $MAGIC using SushiSwap.

### i. Navigate to [SushiSwap](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=\&outputCurrency=0x539bdE0d7Dbd336b79148AA742883198BBF60342) and ensure you are on Arbitrum (not L1 / Ethereum Mainnet).

If you are on another network and not Arbitrum, follow these screenshot instructions to switch between networks.

![At the top, click the "Ethereum" button near the middle of the screen.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1) (1) (1).png>)

![Click the Arbitrum network.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png>)

![Review the prompt that appears and click "Switch network".](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (13) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

### ii. Purchase $MAGIC

Now that you're on the Arbitrum network (you can confirm this with the "Arbitrum" button at the top-middle of the screen), you're ready to buy some $MAGIC.

![Click the "Select a token" button in the "Swap To (est.):" field.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1) (1).png>)

![Type in "MAGIC" to find the $MAGIC token. If you don't have any $MAGIC, the number to the right will read "0".](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (1) (1) (1).png>)

![Confirm that the screen looks like this to swap buy $MAGIC with ETH.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1) (1) (1).png>)

![Enter the amount of MAGIC you'd like to purchase OR the amount of ETH you'd like to spend. Click the "Swap" button when you're ready.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

![Review the swap details and, when you're happy, click "Confirm Swap".](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)

![Review the MetaMask notification that appears and confirm the transaction once you've reviewed and are okay with all of the details.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1).png>)

**Note:** These steps are also applicable if you have a hardware wallet like a Ledger or a Trezor.
{% endhint %}

From here, you are all set to begin purchasing NFTs on the [Treasure Marketplace](https://marketplace.treasure.lol) or staking your $MAGIC in the [Genesis Mine](https://mine.treasure.lol).
