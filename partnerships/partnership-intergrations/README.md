# Partnership Intergrations

## What are integrated projects?

Partnerships are Tresure's way of storing the lore of other metaverses and propagating our resource model within said metaverses.

This further encapsulates the idea of extrinsically composable and intrinsically modular resources (Treasures and $MAGIC) to create a shared economic model across metaverses.

## What about community projects?

Community projects are currently being built within the Treasure community but have not yet been formally integrated. These projects still need to go through the process to become listed on the Treasure Marketplace.
