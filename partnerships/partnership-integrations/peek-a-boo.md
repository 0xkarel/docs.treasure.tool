# ðŸ‘» Peek-A-Boo

## Overview

Peek-A-Boo is a collection of adorable Ghosts and Busters inspired by Doodles. The Peek-A-Boo NFTs have over 80 \*\*\*\* different traits including faces, clothes, hats, items, and backgrounds. Each Peek-A-Boo is a unique, non-fungible token (NFT) on the Arbitrum \*\*\*\* blockchain.

On January 9, Treasure announced Peek-A-Boo as its [first project in the TreasureDAO Launchpad](https://twitter.com/Treasure\_NFT/status/1480083994905616384) and will be listed on the [Treasure Marketplace](https://marketplace.treasure.lol).

## How it works

Peek-A-Boo is releasing a P2E NFT Game alongside the adorable Ghost and Buster NFTs. The game is called Hide-N-Seek and it will feature battleship-style gameplay. Ghosts can passively earn $BOO by staking their ghosts normally, or staking their ghosts onto a GhostMap. Busters can passively earn $BOO by staking their busters normally, or actively earn $BOO by playing and winning GhostMaps.
