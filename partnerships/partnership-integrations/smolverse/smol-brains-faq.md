# Smol Brains FAQ

## How do I get Smol Brains?

After a fun and innovative whitelist process, all Smol Brains were claimed (for free!) by members of the community Discord. But don't worry â€“ you can still buy Smol Brains on the secondary market at [Treasure Marketplace](https://marketplace.treasure.lol) on Arbitrum.

If you were part of the original whitelist, you will have until the end of time to mint your Smol Brains.

## What can I do with Smol Brains?

You can stake your Smol Brains to earn 10 IQ points per day. To stake your Smol Brain, you'll need Smol Brains Land which you can purchase on the secondary market at the [Treasure Marketplace](https://marketplace.treasure.lol/collection/0xd666d1cc3102cd03e07794a61e5f4333b4239f53).

The smart contract collects the average IQ of all **staked** Smol Brains on a continuous basis. For every 10 point increase in the average Smol Brain IQ, a new technological development will appear on your Smol Brain Land as long as you have a Smol Brain staked with the equivalent or higher of the average IQ.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if the average Smol Brain IQ is 200 and your staked Smol Brain has an IQ of 205, you'll have all available technological developments on your land. You only need one Smol Brain above the average IQ on your land to unlock the technological developments.
{% endhint %}

At 50 points, your Smol Brain's head expands one size larger to a maximum of six possible sizes (representing 300 IQ).

Once your Smol Brain is at max capacity, new exciting things will start happening. This will include breeding which will initiate after the first three months, enabling you to:
