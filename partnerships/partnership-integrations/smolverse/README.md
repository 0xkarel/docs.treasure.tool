## Overview

BUILDING A SMOLVERSE WITH FREE MINTS AND GOOD VIBES.&#x20;

The long term vision (dream) of Smolverse is create a metaverse (either pixelated or 3D) where smolfrens can walk around, drive, shop, hang out.&#x20;

**Please Note**: Smolverse currently encompasses Smol Brains and Smol Bodies.

## Smol Brains

You start with 2 monkeys and a piece of land. You are able to stake your monkeys to earn IQ. Collective IQ is rebasing. The more IQ that is staked, the faster the monkeys breed and the bigger brained their children. The bigger brain the monkey society, the more opportunities available to individual monkeys, such as building on their land or even going to space!

## Smol Bodies

The Smol Bodies will inhabit a gym near you, stacking $plates to earn muscle and to not be smol.

Smol Bodies is also an experiment in decentralization. Community members have been selected to lead the project alongside Treasureâ€™s development team, and community ideas, feedback and suggestions will drive development.
