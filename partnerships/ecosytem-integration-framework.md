# Ecosytem Integration Framework

This framework is designed to provide clarity to the growing number of projects looking to deeply integrate into and build on top of the Treasure Ecosystem. It is an important next step in Treasure’s journey to become a ‘decentralised Nintendo’. It serves to:&#x20;

* Help fund the future builders of the Treasure-verse.
* Establish long-term alignment with ecosystem partners to scale growth and network effects.

## **Levels of Integration**

From discussions with and analysis of projects interested in Treasure, three key points of integration have emerged:

1. **Bootstrapped liquidity and funding** - Help bootstrap the project with capital in its initial stages as a replacement for or complementary to a paid mint. This would be in the form of vesting MAGIC with key performance milestones.&#x20;
2. **MAGIC emissions** - MAGIC and Treasure NFTs are woven deeply into the game mechanics and purpose of the project. Projects are seeking MAGIC in two primary ways:&#x20;
   1. Request emissions from TreasureDAO to complement or materially make up MAGIC rewards in their metaverse&#x20;
   2. Raise funds or re-invest their treasury into purchasing MAGIC and Treasure NFTs to actively participate in Bridgeworld, Life and/or Smolverse as a de facto ‘metaverse guild’. This forms both a ‘long’ on the Treasure ecosystem, and as a source of MAGIC for ongoing game rewards.
3. **Treasure Marketplace integration** - All NFTs within an integrated project are exclusively listed on the Treasure Marketplace and denominated in MAGIC. Royalties received in MAGIC would go towards funding ongoing in-game rewards and / or participation in Bridgeworld / Life / Smolverse.

Projects will be required to select **what level of integration is sought** when submitting their application.

## Terms of Integration

Treasure is committed to empowering and enabling the future builders of the ecosystem. This includes MAGIC (or other token) grants, MAGIC emissions and access to a growing network of talent. To align long-term interests and de-risk bad actors / impacts to the DAO, several ‘quid pro quo’ terms will be implemented.

For any project receiving MAGIC for bootstrapping their launch (eg. initial capital) and/or ongoing emissions, the following key terms will be applied:&#x20;

1. MAGIC (or other tokens) supplied by TreasureDAO will be vested and released at agreed milestones and design choices (ie. MAGIC emissions must be used in a thoughtful way, not simple farming and dumping mechanics). Ongoing emissions will be subject to periodic performance reviews (eg. token design, user engagement) to ensure alignment&#x20;
2. If the project has or intends to launch a native token, the project commits to:&#x20;
   1. Token X <> MAGIC as their primary LP&#x20;
   2. Listing on a Treasure AMM (if and when one is developed)
3. The project will provide TreasureDAO a commensurate value of NFTs / native tokens (eg. akin to a Treasury Swap) to align long-term interests. These will be subject to vesting periods.

## Assessment Criteria

It is vital that a rigorous process for vetting and ongoing performance is conducted to ensure the long-term sustainability of the DAO and the broader ecosystem. The Council has developed several criteria that projects **must meet** in order to receive support from the DAO. These are principle-based to account for the nuances in a nascent and emerging space brimming with innovation each day.

| Criteria                                                             | Key Success Factors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
