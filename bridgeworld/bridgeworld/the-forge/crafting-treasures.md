# Crafting Treasures

## How do you craft Treasures?

To craft Treasures, your Legion will need to go on quests in the Ivory tower to find varying tiers of Treasure Fragments. While questing, legions also receive assets known as Prism Shards which are required in combination with Treasure Fragments to create Treasures.  Note - Legions do not earn XP from crafting.

Crafting Treasures require specific Treasure Fragment tiers and affinities to craft a Treasure of that specific tier/affinity. There are 3 categories of treasure affinities:\
&#x20;    1\.  Alchemy/Arcana\
&#x20;    2\. Enchanting/Brewing\
&#x20;    3\. Leatherworking/Smithing

Each affinity category has five tiers of treasures within it (see **Treasure Affinities**).&#x20;

Legions craft Treasures:\
&#x20;    \- Near instantly (there is no crafting time)\
&#x20;    \- With a 100% success rate\
&#x20;    \- Without the need to pay MAGIC
