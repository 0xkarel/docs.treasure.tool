# Harvesters

## Overview

Harvesters are ancient constructs that Bridgeworld Legions have harnessed to procure MAGIC. Harvesters find and extract MAGIC from within Bridgeworld that players and guilds must compete over via coordination and games of strategy for access. They serve two primary purposes:&#x20;

1. Function as the primary reward mechanism for players who play, engage, and contribute to the Bridgeworld and greater Treasure economy
2. Serve as the primary utility for acquiring Treasures

Harvesters will start as roaming creatures for the Treasure Legions NFT collection to tame, capture, stake, and procure MAGIC. They are flexible and have the ability to be configured for other NFT collections. In the future, some Harvesters may be open to a “Harvester Takeover”, wherein another collection has the opportunity to contest and take control of a specific Harvester.

Players and Guilds can compete for increased emissions by utilising Treasures to craft and construct Harvester Parts and special mining Extractors which are used in a social coordination game to boost the amount of MAGIC the Harvester produces.&#x20;

Games in the ecosystem may form their own guilds to aid in the accumulation of players and resources towards maximising the use of Harvesters. This interplay between guilds and games leads to collective bargaining between different groups as they exert influence over how the Bridgeworld metagame develops. As each ecosystem metaverse gains a larger amount of engaged players and revenue sources, digital nation states emerge with their own in-game economies, all vying for control over Harvesters.

## Harvesters

Harvesters roam Bridgeworld in effort to extract MAGIC. Legions (and other NFT collections over time) manage how productive the Harvester is by staking various assets in coordination with the rest of the members in their Harvester. &#x20;

### Joining a Harvester

To access a Harvester, a player must first stake a Harvester Part to the Harvester which can be crafted by playing Bridgeworld to find Treasures and crafting them into Harvester Parts in the Forge by level 3 (minimum) Legions. Each Harvester Part staked in the Harvester gives that specific wallet address a 30,000 MAGIC allocation to deposit.

Dedicated players may produce a large number of Harvester Parts and can bind a maximum of 40 Harvester Parts per address, leading to a maximum 1.2M MAGIC that can be staked per address in a Harvester.&#x20;

### Managing a Harvester

Once a player has joined a Harvester, their responsibility is to stake various assets in order to boost the amount of MAGIC the Harvester is capable of finding to reward the rest of the Harvester team. Players can stake the following assets within Harvesters: \
\
1\. Harvester Parts\
2\. MAGIC\
3\. Legions\
4\. Extractors\
5\. Treasures

#### Harvester Parts

In addition to giving a player access to the Harvester and determining their maximum MAGIC deposit capacity, Harvester Parts also increase a Harvester’s Mining Power incrementally, but there are diminishing returns as the number of staked Parts approaches the maximum of 500 parts per Harvester. Harvester Parts can be crafted in the Forge using Treasures.&#x20;

Dedicated players may produce a large number of Harvester Parts and can bind a maximum of 40 Harvester Parts per address, leading to a maximum 1.2M MAGIC that can be staked per address in a Harvester.

Players can only unstake a Harvester Part do if they have no other deposits staked (Legions, Treasures, Extractors, MAGIC).&#x20;

#### MAGIC

When each Harvester is created, it has a maximum capacity of MAGIC that can be staked at any given time. The default maximum capacity when a Harvester is created is 6 million MAGIC (we look to create up to 9 Harvesters with 6 million MAGIC capacity in each).&#x20;

A Utilisation Modifier parameter is implemented to ensure a minimum amount of MAGIC is staked in each Harvester Part to earn emissions. Until 30% of the Harvester’s maximum capacity filled with staked MAGIC, the Harvester will not receive any emissions. At 30% the Harvester will receive half of the potential emission, and emission levels will step up at every 10% staking interval until the harvester is receiving its full share of emissions when above 80% of the Harvester’s maximum capacity is staked.

MAGIC deposited into a Harvester will be locked for 2 weeks. Time locked MAGIC deposits will also be vested on a per second basis from the point of unlock. Rewards will remain claimable on an ongoing basis. Vesting will occur on a per second basis from the point of unlock with longer time locks experiencing longer vesting times.&#x20;

_Note that after the timelock expires, the deposit will continue enjoying the timelock boost until the player withdraws that deposit._

#### Legions

Staking a Legion helps increase your Harvester’s Mining Power and  boosts your deposit within the Harvester (increasing your share of MAGIC emissions). Legions multiply the size of the Player’s MAGIC deposit, increasing the Player’s personal share of MAGIC rewards inside of the Harvester.&#x20;

Players may stake multiple legions in a Harvester, however each Legion has a “weight class” and there is a maximum tonnage of 200kg to the legions you can stake per wallet. The weights and boosts for each Legion class are outlined in the table below.

#### Extractors

Extractors are key game items in Harvester. Extractors are crafted from Treasure NFTs and can boost a Harvester’s share of MAGIC emissions temporarily. When active, Extractors increase a Harvester’s Mining Power.&#x20;

Extractors can be stacked up to 10 times (per Harvester), but have a finite shelf-life. The lifespan of Extractors is currently 3 hours, and players must be diligent in harvesting MAGIC as close to the expiry as possible or they may forfeit some boosted rewards. Harvester teams must coordinate to ensure someone on their team always has extractors in use to boost their emissions. In the future, other Extractor-like consumables items may appear around the TreasureDAO ecosystem.

Extractor boosts stack additively and have the following attributes:

#### Treasures

Treasures do not boost the amount of MAGIC a Harvester receives but it does boost the amount of MAGIC a player receives within the Harvester. As with the Atlas mine, players may stake and bind up to 20 Treasures to a Harvester to boost a Player’s deposit. As part of active gameplay, a player’s legion characters may find Treasures as loot while questing. The additional boost each staked Treasure provides is determined by rarity.

### Calculating a Harvester's emissions

The share of MAGIC emissions each Harvester receives is simply its “Mining Power” as a ratio of all other Harvesters’ “Mining Powers” including the Atlas Mine. View [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17\_by-FXoXTUcOBPK2MiBmK50jCjZl8iMFwyt9iI3bvk/edit#heading=h.ssy8ir4fxfq) for more information on calculating a harvester's emissions.&#x20;
