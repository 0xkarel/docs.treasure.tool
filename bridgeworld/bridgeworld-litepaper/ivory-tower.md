# Ivory Tower

## Questing Overview

The Ivory Tower is where Legions can set out on quests in search of Essence of Starlight, Treasure Fragments, and Prysm Shards. **Note** - Genesis Legions have the added advantage of finding full Treasures (in addition to the above).&#x20;

Rewards from questing are used in a variety of ways across Bridgeworld. For example, treasure fragments can be used to craft full treasures within the Forge. Essence of starlight, a liquid form of MAGIC, is used to tattoo Legions with one of Bridgeworld's constellations onto their skin so they can equip more treasures while on their quest to earn higher tiered Treasure Fragments.&#x20;

Legions gain experience as they explore Bridgeworld’s frontiers. Questing points are awarded after each completed quests and are used to increase a legion's questing experience level. The higher a legion's questing level the farther they can go in a quest. Currently the farthest a legion can travel in a quest is through part 3 (this will be discussed more below). &#x20;

## Embarking on Quests <a href="#docs-internal-guid-de6c823b-7fff-1266-a429-e0660af7e70c" id="docs-internal-guid-de6c823b-7fff-1266-a429-e0660af7e70c"></a>

There are three zones a Legion can quest in. Each zone drops a specific affinity of Treasure fragments which can then be used to craft full treasures based on their affinity type. View [here](the-forge.md#treasure-affinities) for an overview of which affinities craft certain treasures.&#x20;

#### Questing Zones and Fragment Drops

1. Corruption Canyons ==> drops Alchemy and Arcana Treasure Fragments
2. Desert Ruins ==> drops Smithing and Leatherworking Fragments
3. Icy Ascent ==> drops Enchanting and Brewing Fragments

Legions have the opportunity to quest through three sections of a quest. In order to progress further into a journey, legions must satisfy questing level requirements:

* Section 1: Requires Legions' to be questing level 1
* Section 2: Requires Legions' to be questing level 2
* Section 3: Requires Legions' to be questing level 3

Continuing a journey for rarer treasures comes with risk. Users forfeit whatever loot they earned in the previous sections **(see** [**Rewards Section**](ivory-tower.md#quest-rewards)**)**, and run the risk of falling into “stasis”, which will temporarily immobilize the legion (4 hrs at the time of writing).&#x20;

Each level of constellation reduces stasis risk from the default 30% chance (see chart below).&#x20;

#### Zone Constellation Types

Each questing “zone” is affiliated with **two** elemental constellations. In order for constellations to have any effect for a particular zone (ie reduce stasis), legions must upgrade one of the two correct constellations for the right zone. The “zone elemental affinities” are as follows:

* Corruption Canyons: Earth, Fire
* Desert Ruins: Water, Wind
* Icy Ascent: Dark, Light

#### Equipping Legion's with Treasures

Legion's with a questing level of at least 3 have the opportunity to quest through section 3 of a quest which gives them the opportunity to play Treasure Triad (a card game described in more detail below). In order to play Treasure Triad, Legions need to equip at least 1 Treasure on their quest. Note - legions below questing level 3 can still quest but will not be able to quest to section 3. \

## **Ending Journeys with Treasure Triad**

Treasure Triad Video Tutorial
{% endembed %}

Legions who have questing level 3 (or greater) and equipped treasures will play the Treasure Triad game in the last part of their quest. The goal is to flip as many cards to your control which boosts the change your legion receives higher tiered Treasure Fragments and/or Treasures.&#x20;

![Treasure Triad](../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_65.jpg)

The game works as follows:

1. Cards have 4 stats for the “north”, “east”, “south”, and “west” sides of the card.&#x20;
2. When a card is placed next to another card, if the stats on your card is higher on the touching sides, you flip the adjacent card to your color!
3. Players can place up to 3 cards on the grid by dragging and dropping a Treasure in their deck to an unflipped grid location of their choice.&#x20;
   * Simply click on a card to unplay it and move it back to your deck.&#x20;
4. Grid cells with a purple color have a status effect of “corruption”. If you do not play a card on a corrupted grid cell, your legion will be put in stasis (frozen for X hours).&#x20;
   * Game generates at most 2 corrupted cells.
   * 1 unflipped “corruption” grid cell ⇒ 12 hrs stasis
   * 2 unflipped “corruption” grid cells ⇒ 24 hrs stasis
   * Note - genesis legions cannot be put in stasis.
5. Once you play 3 cards, click “Finish Games” to submit a metamask transaction to complete the quest. Note that you do not have to place all 3 cards to finish the game.&#x20;
6. The more cards flipped into your control, the higher the drop rate!
   * 1 card ⇒ +3%
   * 2 cards ⇒ +6%
   * 3 cards ⇒ +9%
   * Fragment standard drop rate is 60% so 3 cards flipped = 60 + 9 = 69%

### Additional Game Mechanics

Two grid cells in the game are randomly selected to have “affinities” (alchemy, arcana, etc).&#x20;

* Treasures are grouped into “affinities”
  * Alchemy, arcana, brewing, leatherworking, smithing, etc
* If a treasure of the same affinity as the cell is placed, the card enjoys a +1 stat boost
  * e.g. Donkey is a “leather working” affinity treasure. When placed on a cell with a “leather working” affinity, will enjoy a +1 boost to stats.
*   Each legion class has “affinities”, when they place a card on the gridCell with the same affinity, they get a +1 boost to the stats

    * Legion affinities are listed in the table below.

## Quest Rewards

Drop rates for Treasure fragments ([**soulbound** ](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html)**and non-transferable**) are set to 60%, and each zone drops a category of treasure fragments as follows:

* Corruption Canyons ⇒ Alchemy/Arcana fragments
* Icy Ascent ⇒ Enchanting/Brewing fragments
* Desert Ruins ⇒ Smithing/Leatherworking fragments

The probability of finding different rarity tiers of treasure fragments are as follows:

Questing EXP and Other Loot earned depends on the distance traveled:

### Bonuses for Genesis Legions <a href="#docs-internal-guid-c9503063-7fff-6414-44f5-cb6801d60334" id="docs-internal-guid-c9503063-7fff-6414-44f5-cb6801d60334"></a>

Genesis Legions are immune to stasis in questing, have higher chances of finding treasure fragments, and have an additional chance to earn an additional full treasure during quests.

## Mini Crafts <a href="#docs-internal-guid-074a1c70-7fff-47e5-488b-7903cf74a406" id="docs-internal-guid-074a1c70-7fff-47e5-488b-7903cf74a406"></a>

Mini Crafts are entry level crafting recipes for players to experiment without the risk of breaking treasures. Mini Crafts use treasure fragments and Prism shards to craft a Treasure. Some notable features include:&#x20;

* Mini Crafts accessible by level 1 crafters.
* Mini Craft is instant
* Mini-craft has no influence on summoning probabilities
* Fragments are soul-bound and cannot be mass purchased to max out crafting level.

View [here](https://docs.treasure.lol/bridgeworld/bridgeworld-litepaper/the-forge) for more information on Minicrafting.&#x20;

## Fragment Swapper

Due to a bug causing Treasure Fragments dropped during quests through the Desert Ruins and Icy Ascent to be switched, we have deployed a Fragment Swapper smart contract that will allow you to swap Brewing/Enchanting and Leathworking/Smithing Treasure Fragments of any tier for a limited time. The bug was patched on Monday, June 6, 2022 and all quests started after then will drop the correct Fragments without requiring any swapping.

NOTE: Alchemy/Arcana Treasure Fragments will **NOT** be eligible for swapping as they were not affected by the bug.

### Instructions

1. Go to the [Fragment Swapper contract on Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x54d154524a7D27FBEd750bf0bfF95822C5667256#writeProxyContract) and navigate to Contract > Write as Proxy
2. Click "Connect to Web3" and connect your wallet
3. Scroll down to `9. swapFragments`
4. Enter the list of Fragments you want to swap with the following format:

```
[[tokenId1,quantity1],[tokenId2,quantity2],...]
```

Eligible Treasure Fragment token IDs are as follows:

#### Brewing/Enchanting

| Tier | Token ID |
| ---- | -------- |
| T1   | 6        |
| T2   | 7        |
| T3   | 8        |
| T4   | 9        |
| T5   | 10       |

#### Leatherworking/Smithing

| Tier | Token ID |
| ---- | -------- |
| T1   | 11       |
| T2   | 12       |
| T3   | 13       |
| T4   | 14       |
| T5   | 15       |

For example, if you want to swap three T4 Brewing/Enchanting Fragments and two T5 Leathworking/Smithing Fragments, your input would be:

`[[9,3],[15,2]]`

5\. Click "Write" and send the transaction

6\. Wait a few minutes, then view your updated Resources inventory on the Bridgeworld UI
