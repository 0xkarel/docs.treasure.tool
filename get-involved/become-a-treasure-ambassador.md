## **Overview**

Calling all Treasure maxis and community members who want to shape the future of Treasure! Treasure has launched a brand new Ambassador program that may just be a fit for you.

Treasure's Ambassador program allows you to be a spokesperson of Treasure, represent your local community, and help spread the Treasure vision to the masses!

The Treasure Ambassador program is separate from the Treasure Create program. You donâ€™t need to be a content creator to be an Ambassador (though you can be if you want!). We are looking for highly engaged community members to get involved in as many regions across the world.

Aside from being an active Treasure community member, we're looking for people with strong web3 experience, and other skills such as writing and event hosting. We are also prioritizing non-English speaking applicants and community members outside of North America to grow our global presence and make our content more accessible to new audiences.

**TL;DR:**

1. Treasure's Ambassador Program is for highly engaged community members, and people passionate about web3.
2. The program is open to all, but we especially encourage members who speak additional languages other than English and/or who live in non-North American countries to apply.
3. Grow your personal network and resume, develop community management skills, gain access to the Treasure team and future opportunities to be rewarded through an affiliate program.

## **Help Shape Your Community**

Our Ambassador Program is all about empowering Treasure's biggest champions. More than a representative, our Ambassadors will be allies to the core Treasure team. Below are non-exhaustive examples of how you may participate as an Ambassador:

* Introduce Treasure to new community members by representing and advocating for Treasure in you region/community
* Manage and engage with your regional Treasure community regularly (in Discord's language channels, and elsewhere)
* Create educational content to be shared with your audiences across different channels
* Contribute to the translations of documents, announcements, website, and more
* Join calls with the Treasure team and provide insightful feedback about your regional group
* Amplify events and announcements beyond the Treasure Discord so we're heard far and wide
* Host AMAs or local meetups (optional)

## Why Become a Treasure Ambassador?

* **Represent Treasure:** Advocate for the future of Treasure, and play a part in growing our global presence
* **Networking:** Grow your professional network and have a direct line to the Treasure team
* **Develop Your Professional Portfolio:** Gain valuable leadership and web3 skills through community building initiatives
* **Be Rewarded:** Be eligible to partake in future incentives like an affiliate program. Stay tuned!
