# Governance

## **Overview**

* [**Forum**](https://treasuredao.freeflarum.com)**:** Place to discuss new proposals and review formalized TIPs
* ****[**Snapshot**](https://snapshot.org/#/treasuredao.eth)**:** Where you go to vote on proposals for implementations by the DAO

## **Process**&#x20;

1. Submission of Treasure DAO Improvement Proposals (TIP) via our [Treasure DAO forum](https://treasuredao.freeflarum.com/t/general) to gauge interest and spark healthy conversation - which can be continued in our new dedicated Discord channels for "TIPs" and "Governance"
2. If quorum and sufficient engagement achieved, move to formal Snapshot voting which will ratify proposals for implementation by the DAO&#x20;

## **gMAGIC**

Governance MAGIC (or "gMAGIC") introduces concepts from the veCRV model where governance rights are weighted towards community members who commit and provide to the longer term success of the DAO. As such:

* Only staked MAGIC (veMAGIC) or MAGIC in LP within the rewards contract will count for voting - liquid MAGIC (eg. unstaked or uncommited MAGIC) will NOT count for governance
* gMAGIC derived from the Genesis Mine is weighted based on timelock - the longer the lock, the higher the weight.

gMAGIC automatically adjusts for new positions in the Genesis Mine and SLP rewards contract.

## **Snapshot Voting**

Snapshot voting will be based on your gMAGIC holdings on Arbitrum only.&#x20;

If you are already staked in the Genesis Mine or have SLP within the LP rewards contract, you do NOT need to do anything.&#x20;

To participate in voting, you will need to connect your wallet to our Snapshot page (to be shared at later date) and your gMAGIC holdings will automatically appear. You must be connected to the Arbitrum network.

We look forward to building out Treasure together with the community!
