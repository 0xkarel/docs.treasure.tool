# Snapshot Voting

## How to participate in snapshot voting

1. Follow the Snapshot link to the TIP.
2. Connect the MetaMask wallet associated with your $MAGIC holdings. You must be on the Arbitrum network.
3.  Select your choice to either:

    1. **Approve** TIP; or
    2. **Reject** TIP

    Only veMAGIC holders (staked in the Genesis Mine and/or $MAGIC-WETH SLP staked in the Arbitrum LP Rewards contract) are eligible to vote with gMAGIC. The longer the vest on your veMAGIC, the higher the weight of your vote.
4. Sign to vote once you've made your selection (this does not incur gas fees). Select carefully as you may not be able to change your vote.
