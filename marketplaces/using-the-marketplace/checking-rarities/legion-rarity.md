## Non-Genesis Legions in Existence

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: As per TIP-04, the TreasureDAO team will be minting 300 additional **Gen1 Common Legions** as part of our onboarding new user program.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** As the Treasure metaverse scales, Gen1 Legions will be inflated via summoning mechanics. This is vital to ensure there exists a vibrant and participatory ecosystem that can accommodate the next wave of users.
