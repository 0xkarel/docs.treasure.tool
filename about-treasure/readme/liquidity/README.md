# Liquidity

## Sustainable Liquidity

MAGIC is a scarce resource. This is a key tenet of the Treasure metaverse. Mining rewards will continue to halve each year. LP rewards will align with this trajectory to ensure 1) ecosystem balance and 2) long-term sustainability. Achieving sustainable liquidity will involve:

* a progressive reduction in LP rewards to sustainable emissions, reviewed on an ongoing basis;
* building protocol-owned liquidity; and
* exploration of alternative liquidity solutions.
