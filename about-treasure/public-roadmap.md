# Public Roadmap

To provide the community with greater transparency into the work that the core contributor team is conducting for the benefit of the Treasure ecosystem, a high-level public roadmap has been made available and will be regularly maintained for transparency.

The public roadmap aims to strike a balance between transparency, innovation, and pragmatism. By making this public, we hope to equip the Treasure community to make informed decisions to better support and contribute to the overall network while maintaining a competitive edge and the ability to surprise and delight.
