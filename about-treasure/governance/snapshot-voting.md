# Snapshot Voting

## How to participate in Snapshot voting

1. Follow the Snapshot link to the TIP.
2. Connect the MetaMask wallet associated with your $MAGIC holdings. You must be on the Arbitrum network.
3.  Select your choice to either:

    1. **Approve** TIP; or
    2. **Reject** TIP

    Only MAGIC stakers (Harvesters and Governance Staking) and those with $MAGIC-WETH SLP in the Arbitrum LP Rewards contract are eligible to vote with gMAGIC.
4. Sign to vote once you've made your selection (this does not incur gas fees). Select carefully as you may not be able to change your vote.
