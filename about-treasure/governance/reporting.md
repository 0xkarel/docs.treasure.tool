# Reporting

As part of [TIP-26](https://commonwealth.im/treasure-dao/discussion/11263-tip26-increase-transparancy-and-accountability), the Treasure council has committed to providing the TreasureDAO community with quarterly reports that cover the state of DAO operations and financials while also providing greater visibility into high-level roadmap and key initiatives that the core contributor team are undertaking.

Reports will be published on a recurring basis within forty-five (45) days after the end of each quarter. In these reports, the following details will be provided:

* Current DAO treasury balance reported by tokens held and amount;
* Revenue generated through the marketplace, first-party games, Magicswap, and other revenue streams;
* Details pertaining to any conversion of MAGIC from revenue through the self-funding treasury management initiative in partnership with Flowdesk; and
* Summary of operational expenses and other business costs (payroll, partnerships, technology, legal expenses, etc.).
