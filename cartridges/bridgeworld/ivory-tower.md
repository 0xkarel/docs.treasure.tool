# Ivory Tower

## Questing Overview

The Ivory Tower is where Legions can set out on quests in search of valuable resources such as Essence of Starlight, Treasure Fragments, and Prism Shards.&#x20;

_Note**:** Genesis Legions have the added advantage of finding full Treasures (in addition to the above)._&#x20;

Rewards from questing are used in a variety of ways across Bridgeworld. Treasure Fragments can be used to craft full Treasures in [The Forge](the-forge/). Essence of Starlight, a liquid form of MAGIC, is used to tattoo Legions with one of Bridgeworld's constellations onto their skin so they can equip more Treasures while on quests to earn higher tiered Treasure Fragments.

Legions gain experience as they explore Bridgeworld’s frontiers. Questing points are awarded after each completed quest and are used to increase a Legion's questing experience level. The max questing level is 6.&#x20;

Each quest has 3 parts. The higher a Legion's questing level, the farther they can go in each quest and the higher chance they find items from questing. Each time a legion quests, the distance the Legion traveled is added to the Legion's stats.  Each part of a quest is considered 10 kilometers.  Part 3 of a quest enables Legions to play [Treasure Triad](ivory-tower.md#ending-journeys-with-treasure-triad).&#x20;

## Embarking on Quests <a href="#docs-internal-guid-de6c823b-7fff-1266-a429-e0660af7e70c" id="docs-internal-guid-de6c823b-7fff-1266-a429-e0660af7e70c"></a>

There are three regions a Legion can quest in. Each region drops a specific affinity of Treasure Fragments which can then be used to Mini Craft full Treasures based on their affinity type. View [here](the-forge/#treasure-affinities) for an overview of Treasure affinities.

Legions have the opportunity to quest through three parts of a quest. In order to progress further into a journey, Legions must satisfy questing level requirements:

* Part 1: Requires Legions to be at least Questing level 1
* Part 2: Requires Legions to be at least Questing level 2
* Part 3: Requires Legions to be at least Questing level 3

Continuing a journey for rarer Treasures comes with risk. Users forfeit whatever loot they earned in the previous sections **(see** [**Rewards Section**](ivory-tower.md#quest-rewards)**)**, and run the risk of falling into “stasis”, which will temporarily immobilize the legion (4 hrs at the time of writing).&#x20;

Each level of constellation reduces stasis risk from the default 30% chance:&#x20;

#### Region Constellation Types

Each questing region is affiliated with **two** elemental constellations. In order for constellations to have any effect for a particular region (i.e., reduce stasis and enable Treasures to be equipped), Legions must upgrade one of the two correct constellations for the right region. The “region elemental affinities” are as follows:

* Corruption Canyons: Earth, Fire
* Desert Ruins: Water, Wind
* Icy Ascent: Dark, Light

#### Equipping Legions with Treasures

Legions with a Questing level of at least 3 have the opportunity to quest through Part 3, which gives them the opportunity to play Treasure Triad (a card game described in more detail below). In order to play Treasure Triad, Legions need to equip at least 1 Treasure on their quest. **NOTE:** Legions below Questing level 3 can still quest but will not be able to reach Part 3.&#x20;

## **Ending Journeys with Treasure Triad**

Treasure Triad Video Tutorial
{% endembed %}

Legions who have a Questing level of at least 3 and equipped Treasures must play the Treasure Triad game in the last part of their quest. The goal is to flip as many cards to your control, which boosts the chance your Legion receives higher tiered Treasure Fragments and/or Treasures.&#x20;

![Treasure Triad](../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_65.jpg)

The game works as follows:

1. Cards have 4 stats for the “North”, “East”, “South”, and “West” sides of the card.&#x20;
2. When a card is placed next to another card, if the stats on your card are higher on the touching sides, you flip the adjacent cards to your color.
3. Players can place **up to 3 cards** on the grid by dragging and dropping a Treasure from their deck to an unflipped grid location of their choice.&#x20;
   * Simply click on a card to unplay it and move it back to your deck.&#x20;
4. Grid cells with a purple color have a status effect of “corruption”. If you do not play a card on a corrupted grid cell, your legion will be put in stasis (frozen for X hours).&#x20;
   * Game generates at most 2 corrupted cells.
   * 1 unflipped “corruption” grid cell ⇒ 12 hrs stasis
   * 2 unflipped “corruption” grid cells ⇒ 24 hrs stasis
   * **NOTE:** Genesis Legions cannot be put in stasis
5. Once you play 3 cards, click “End Games” to submit a transaction to end or restart your quests. Note that you do not have to place all 3 cards to finish a game.
6. The more cards flipped into your control, the higher the drop rate:
   * 1 card ⇒ +5%
   * 2 cards ⇒ +10%
   * 3 cards ⇒ +15%
   * If the current fragment drop rate is 40%, with 3 cards flipped = 40% \* (1 + 15%) = 46%

### Additional Game Mechanics

Two grid cells in the game are randomly selected to have affinities, and matching Treasures/Legions with them will offer game boosts:

* Treasures are grouped into affinities of Alchemy, Arcana, Brewing, Enchanting, Leatherworking, and Smithing
* If a Treasure matches the affinity of the cell it is placed on, the card enjoys a +1 stat boost on all sides.
  * For example, Donkey is a Leathworking Treasure so when it is placed on a cell with a Leatherworking affinity, it will enjoy a +1 boost to stats
* Each Legion class is associated with multiple affinities (see chart below). If a Legion matches the affinity of a Treasure that also matches the affinity of the cell it is placed on, the card enjoys a +2 stat boost on all sides.
  * For example, Donkey is a Leatherworking Treasure, so when it is placed on a cell with a Leatherworking affinity by a Legion with class Assassin, it will enjoy a +2 boost to stats

| Legion Class                                                                     | Affinities               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1/1 (Bombmaker, Clocksnatcher, Dreamwinder, Fallen, Warlock)                     | All                      |
| All-Class (Ashen Kingsguard, Clockwork Marine, Executioner, Reaper, Shadowguard) | All                      |
| Numeraire                                                                        | Alchemy & Arcana         |
| Riverman                                                                         | Brewing & Enchanting     |
| Ranger                                                                           | Alchemy & Leatherworking |
| Fighter                                                                          | Enchanting & Smithing    |
| Spellcaster                                                                      | Arcana & Enchanting      |
| Siege                                                                            | Alchemy & Smithing       |
| Assassin                                                                         | Brewing & Leatherworking |

### Treasure Triad Card Stats

![Diagram showing Treasure tiers, affinities, and Treasure Triad card stats](../../.gitbook/assets/triad\_points\_on\_treasures.jpg)

## Quest Rewards

During a questing Legions gain:&#x20;

1. Questing XP
2. Essence of Starlight (EoS) and Prism Shards
3. 0.001% chance of finding a [Universal Lock](https://trove.treasure.lol/collection/consumables/10) (in all regions and sections)
4. And a chance of finding **Treasure Fragments**

For Questing XP, EoS and Prism Shards, the rewards depends on the distance traveled:

#### Treasure Droprates

Drop rates for Treasure Fragments ([**soulbound** ](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html)**and non-transferable**) are based on the below formula and each region drops a category of Treasure Fragments as follows:

* Corruption Canyons ⇒ Alchemy/Arcana Fragments
* Icy Ascent ⇒ Enchanting/Brewing Fragments
* Desert Ruins ⇒ Smithing/Leatherworking Fragments

The chance of earning a Treasure Fragment = **1/(1 + (N/k \* s)^2)**&#x20;

* N = the number of recruits questing
* s = a settable constant set to 1
* k =  the number of Treasure fragments in the pool when legion ends the quest.&#x20;
  * The number of Treasure fragments gradually increases every second at a fixed rate
    * e.g. if there is a 30,000 monthly cap for T5, then this works out to be 30000/(30\*24\*60\*60) = 0.0115740 T5 Treasures per second

This formula produces a drop rate graph as follows:

| Treasure Tier | Treasure Fragments emitted per Month |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| T5            | 30,000                               |
| T4            | 21,000                               |
| T3            | 12,000                               |
| T2            | 3,000                                |
| T1            | 1,500                                |

The probability of finding different rarity tiers of Treasure Fragments are outlined below.&#x20;

Note Legions can earn multiple fragment Tiers in each section based on the above drop-rate formula, but only one of each tier.

**For section 1**: Legions have a chance of finding up to 2 fragments (1x T5, 1x T4) or none at all.

_You have a chance to find either: (1x T5 and 1x T4) or (1x T5) or (1x T4) or nothing at all. You cannot get 2x T4 or 2x T5._

**For section 2**: Legions have a chance of finding up to 3 fragments: (1x T5, 1x T4, 1x T3) or none at all.

**For section 3**: Legions have a chance of finding up to 3 fragments: (1x T1, 1x T2, 1x T3) or none at all.\
\
Travelling to latter sections does not give you rewards from previous sections.



Additional Treasure Fragments are emitted from separate pools for Recruits and ecosystem partners like Realm. For example:

| Treasure Tier | Treasure Fragments emitted per Month |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Recruits      | 5,000                                |
| Realm         | 5,000                                |
|               |                                      |

### Bonuses for Questing Level 4/5/6 Legions <a href="#docs-internal-guid-c9503063-7fff-6414-44f5-cb6801d60334" id="docs-internal-guid-c9503063-7fff-6414-44f5-cb6801d60334"></a>

Legions with Questing level 4, 5, or 6 have higher chances of finding Treasure Fragments:

| Questing Level | Boosted chance of Treasure Fragment drops |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Level 4        | (1 + 5%) \* BaseDropRate                  |
| Level 5        | (1 + 10%) \* BaseDropRate                 |
| Level 6        | (1 + 15%) \* BaseDropRate                 |

### Bonuses for Genesis Legions <a href="#docs-internal-guid-c9503063-7fff-6414-44f5-cb6801d60334" id="docs-internal-guid-c9503063-7fff-6414-44f5-cb6801d60334"></a>

Genesis Legions are immune to stasis in questing, have higher chances of finding Treasure Fragments, and have an additional chance to earn a full Treasure during quests:

| Legion Rarity | Chance of finding full treasure | Boosted chance of finding fragments |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Common        | 1%                              | (1 + 2.5%) \* BaseDropRate          |
| Special       | 1.5%                            | (1 + 3.75%) \* BaseDropRate         |
| Uncommon      | 2%                              | (1 + 5%) \* BaseDropRate            |
| Rare          | 4%                              | (1 + 10%) \* BaseDropRate           |
| Legendary     | 12%                             | (1 + 30%) \* BaseDropRate           |

### Stacking Droprate Bonuses

Bonuses to the Treasure Fragment droprates stack as follows:\
(1 + QuestingLvlBonus + CardFlipBonus + GenesisLegionBonus)

So for instance if the current BaseDropRate is 35%, and a lvl 4 Special Genesis Legion is questing and flipped 3x Cards in the Triad Card Game,

The drop rate is: (1 + 5% + 3.75% + 15%) \* 35%&#x20;

\= (1 + 23.75%) \* 35%

\= 43.31%\
