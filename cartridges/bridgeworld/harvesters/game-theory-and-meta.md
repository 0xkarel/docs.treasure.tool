# Game Theory and Meta

The introduction of Harvesters will drive social coordination and progressive changes in strategy as the game meta progresses. Guilds and Sub-DAOs alike, will need to consider the optimal strategy at each stage of the ‘game’ both collectively and as individuals.

We will also seed these dynamics through macro shifts over time that force decision tradeoffs, disincentivise monopolistic behaviors and create meta tension between Harvester owners and new participants. This seeks to keep the economy vibrant, thriving and attractive to new players.

There are no “correct” ways to structure a guild to optimize earnings from harvesters; small elite guilds can thrive, as can larger mainstream guilds.

Some guilds are collectors, and have spent time curating and honing crafting skills to manufacture harvester parts faster than others, others are warlike and have access to the most powerful legions. Other guilds don’t have the wealth or resources, but are simply better at building community and recruiting followers to their cause—and with them, their legions. They find strength in numbers.

In the early stages, guilds that are best able to procure harvester parts, or rapidly recruit new members may have the upper hand and secure large harvester emissions boosts. However, as there are AUM caps on the harvesters (MAGIC caps), there will be a point at which guilds no longer benefit from recruiting more users and instead worry about dilution in their pools.

Wealthier, more entrepreneurial users will gradually want to turn their attention to activating new harvesters in which they can put their full funds to work. There will be resistance for some guilds with whales to grow too large strategically: tension between securing more legions for boosts, versus dilution and limited space in the harvester. On the other hand, guilds formed with many humble, small MAGIC holders (who don’t squabble over AUM caps) may end up getting the largest emissions boosts due to the sheer numbers of their legions. Older abandoned harvesters show signs that even the AUM itself may be upgraded with the correct recipes.

### Social Coordination and Consumables

As the game progresses, legions will be able to craft extractors with a “medium” recipe which helps boost their harvester’s share of emissions temporarily (exact timing to be announced). Only 5 may be stacked in the harvester at any given time (stacks additively), and any additional overlapping extractor boosts will go to waste.

Guilds will need to optimize and ration their extractors over time so that they may maintain a sustained emissions boost in this global coordination game. They may even need to organize members across different time zones to apply boosts strategically so that they don’t fall behind other guilds who have tighter teamwork between their members. Guilds with greater social coordination and discipline can therefore outperform wealthier, but dysfunctional guilds.

Some guilds will specialize in crafting and become highly proficient in sourcing the treasures necessary to produce these items. For these merchant guilds, it may be more economical to deploy legions into crafting and consistently produce excess Extractors to sell to other guilds. Game Theory and Meta
