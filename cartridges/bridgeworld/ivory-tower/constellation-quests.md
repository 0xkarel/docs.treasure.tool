# Constellation Quests

## Embarking on Quests <a href="#docs-internal-guid-de6c823b-7fff-1266-a429-e0660af7e70c" id="docs-internal-guid-de6c823b-7fff-1266-a429-e0660af7e70c"></a>

There are three regions a Legion can quest in. Each region drops a specific affinity of Treasure Fragments which can then be used to Mini Craft full Treasures based on their affinity type. View [here](../the-forge/#treasure-affinities) for an overview of Treasure affinities.

Legions have the opportunity to quest through three parts of a quest. In order to progress further into a journey, Legions must satisfy questing level requirements:

* Part 1: Requires Legions to be at least Questing level 1
* Part 2: Requires Legions to be at least Questing level 2
* Part 3: Requires Legions to be at least Questing level 3

Continuing a journey for rarer Treasures comes with risk. Users forfeit whatever loot they earned in the previous sections **(see** [**Rewards Section**](constellation-quests.md#quest-rewards)**)**, and run the risk of falling into “stasis”, which will temporarily immobilize the legion (4 hrs at the time of writing).&#x20;

Each level of constellation reduces stasis risk from the default 30% chance.&#x20;

Players that travel to the 3rd section must also play the Treasure Triad Card game using equipped Treasures. See [Treasure Triad](treasure-triad.md) for details.

**Each level of constellation protects your legion and reduces the chance of stasis (default 30%):**

| Level 1 Constellation | reduce by 4%     |
| Level 2 Constellation | reduce by 6%     |
| Level 3 Constellation | reduce by 8%     |
| Level 4 Constellation | reduce by 10%    |
| Level 5 Constellation | reduce by 15%    |
| Level 6 Constellation | reduce by 20%    |
| Level 7 Constellation | reduce by 25%    |
