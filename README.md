# Introduction



![](.gitbook/assets/image.png)

## What is Treasure?

Treasure is building composable economic resources to act as bridges between the growing network of metaverses. Cross-ecosystem ties are bolstered through our interrelated resource model:

* **$MAGIC** (Power);
* **Treasures** (NFT | Resources); and&#x20;
* **Legions** (NFT | Players)

Treasure originally began as a complementary addition to the Loot metaverse with composable currencies that adventurers would need in the new metaverse (8 "Treasures" in the form of an NFT). Treasure quickly developed a life of its own and evolved into TreasureDAO, which aims to create a gigaverse based on the interaction between two resources: Treasures and $MAGIC.&#x20;

Treasure aspires to act as the bridge between metaverses. To become the base layer of disparate universes and to power and connect them. $MAGIC aims to be the reserve currency of the metaverse, fueling the ecosystem and making its resources productive.

> Through the ages, there have been countless songs and legends that told the tale of this world. All suspended in time, eclipsed from space -- silent. It was said that this world had no origin; a blank slate. A mere bridge connecting the multitude of other worlds together, from the beginning to the end of time.

> It was a world of _**Treasures**_, of long forgotten relics, and of effaced legends.

> _The Treasure World._

> The celestial ones deemed this world the nexus of all worlds. It weaves other worlds together in perpetuity. _**Legions**_** ** were elected to study the _**Magic**_** ** that sustained this world -- to guide, to govern, and to protect it.

## Who created Treasure?

Treasure was originally created by John Patten and is being built by a distributed pseudo-anonymous team.

## Who runs Treasure?

Treasure is DAO-governed. However, we believe some structure is still needed, and a group of dedicated DAO members and the original founders comprise the "Treasure Council" which executes upon Treasure's vision.

For more information on the Treasure Council and broader team, see[meet-the-team.md](meet-the-team.md "mention").

Decisions are formed by community members on the Discord and made by token holders through [snapshot-voting.md](governance/snapshot-voting.md "mention").&#x20;
