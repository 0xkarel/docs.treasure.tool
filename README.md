# Introduction

![](<.gitbook/assets/1500x500 (2).jpg>)

## What is Treasure?

Treasure is building composable economic resources to act as bridges between the growing network of metaverses. Cross-ecosystem ties are bolstered through our interrelated resource model:

* **$MAGIC** (Power);
* **Treasures** (NFT | Resources); and&#x20;
* **Legions** (NFT | Players)

Treasure originally began as a complementary addition to the Loot metaverse with composable currencies that adventurers would need in the new metaverse (8 "Treasures" in the form of an NFT). Treasure quickly developed a life of its own and evolved into TreasureDAO, which aims to create a gigaverse based on the interaction between two resources: Treasures and $MAGIC.&#x20;

Treasure aspires to act as the bridge between metaverses. To become the base layer of disparate universes and to power and connect them. $MAGIC aims to be the reserve currency of the metaverse, fueling the ecosystem and making its resources productive.

> Through the ages, there have been countless songs and legends that told the tale of this world. All suspended in time, eclipsed from space -- silent. It was said that this world had no origin; a blank slate. A mere bridge connecting the multitude of other worlds together, from the beginning to the end of time.

> Until -- the celestial ones gazed upon this abstract world. They found a world of remains filled with debris from other worlds rich with lore and essence that existed long ago.

> It was a world of _**Treasures**_, of long forgotten relics, and of effaced legends.

> _The Treasure World._

> The celestial ones deemed this world the nexus of all worlds. It weaves other worlds together in perpetuity. _**Legions**_** ** were elected to study the _**Magic**_** ** that sustained this world -- to guide, to govern, and to protect it.

## Vision and Mission

Treasure stays true to the Loot ethos, providing extrinsically composable and intrinsically modular building blocks for the community to expand. This approach has nurtured a strong and highly engaged, grassroots community. Over time, we hope that Treasure can create a highly accessible and engaging ecosystem that fosters a strong sense of belonging and allows users to have genuine fun playing and participating (see [how-to-get-involved.md](get-involved/how-to-get-involved.md "mention") to build with us!).

## Community

TreasureDAO have fought hard to maintain the fair launch nature of the project, to date eschewing outside funding and instead self-financing the project. We genuinely believe that Treasure will form the cradle for a cross-game, cross-chain metaverse. Having built this as a fair launch project will ensure long-term relevance for the project. The collaborators that we have attracted have been drawn to the project due to its genesis story, and we expect the organic growth of the ecosystem to continue to increase the longer that the project is able to sustain full decentralization.

**Note**: All of TreasureDAO's launches have been free and fairly distributed.

## TreasureDAO

Treasure is DAO-governed. To ensure a degree of structure, however, a group of dedicated DAO members from the "Treasure Council" will help execute Treasure's vision.

For more information on the Treasure Council and broader team, see[meet-the-team.md](meet-the-team.md "mention").

Decisions are formed by the DAO and voted by $MAGIC holders through [snapshot-voting.md](governance/snapshot-voting.md "mention").&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Decentralization** solves a crucial scaling problem. There is no way the team (no matter the size) can scrape together a **collective imagination** sufficient to construct the entirety of this metaverse. Decentralization, therefore, **** creates the conditions by which a true metaverse can develop and be **free of proprietary distortion**.&#x20;
