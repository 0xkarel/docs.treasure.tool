## What is Treasure Docs?

Treasure Docs is the community documentation hub for the [Treasure](https://treasure.lol) ecosystem. Treasure is building composable economic resources to act as bridges between the growing network of metaverses. Treasure originally began as a complementary addition to the Loot metaverse with composable currencies that adventurers would need in the new metaverse (8 "Treasures" in the form of an NFT). Treasure quickly developed a life of its own and evolved into TreasureDAO, which aims to create a gigaverse based on the interaction between two resources: Treasures and $MAGIC.
