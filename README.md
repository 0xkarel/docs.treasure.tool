# Introduction

## What is Treasure?

Treasure bridges the growing network of metaverses through an open and composable approach to the convergence of NFTs, DeFi and Gaming.

Cross-ecosystem ties are bolstered through our interrelated resource model:

* $MAGIC (Power);
* Treasures (NFT | Resources); and&#x20;
* Legions (NFT | Players)

Treasure originally began as a complementary addition to the Loot metaverse with composable currencies that adventurers would need in the new metaverse (8 "Treasures" in the form of an NFT). Treasure quickly developed a life of its own and evolved into TreasureDAO, which aims to create a gigaverse based on the interaction between two resources - Treasures and $MAGIC.&#x20;

Treasure aspires to act as the bridge between metaverses. To become the base layer of disparate universes and to power and connect them. $MAGIC aims to be the reserve currency of the metaverse, fueling the ecosystem and making its resources productive.

## Who created Treasure?

Treasure was ideated by John Patten and is being built by a distributed pseudo-anonymous team.

## Who runs Treasure?

Treasure is DAO-governed. However, we believe some structure is still needed and a group of dedicated DAO members and the original founders comprise the "Treasure Council" which execute upon Treasure's vision.

For more information on the Treasure Council and broader team, see[meet-the-team.md](meet-the-team.md "mention").

Decisions are formed by community members on the Discord and made by token holders through [snapshot-voting.md](governance/snapshot-voting.md "mention").&#x20;
