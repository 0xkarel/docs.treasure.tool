# Game Builders Program

## What is the Treasure Game Builders Program (GBP)?

The **GBP** aims to support and incentivise aligned, high potential games building in the Treasure ecosystem.

There are two integration tiers to aim for:

Access the Exclusive Treasure Partners Discord, Treasure and Arbitrum team support, and compete for the chance to win periodic MAGIC rewards as a top driver of ecosystem priorities.

Gold Tier plus end-to-end advisory and support from Treasure’s internal and industry expert Network (including Arbitrum technical and marketing) to kickstart adoption and hypercharge growth.

To access these benefits, game builders must collect and fill their **Treasure Builders Pass (BPass)** with **Badges** obtained from achieving milestones in five key integration areas.

Unlocking fun, composability across games is a key Treasure goal. Experimentation is encouraged, particularly for deeper levels of integration.
