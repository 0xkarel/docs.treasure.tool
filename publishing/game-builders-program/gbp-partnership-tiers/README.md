## Treasure Builders Pass

So you want to redefine gaming with a vibrant community and ecosystem of builders in the **GBP**? Great! You’re in the right place, but you’re going to need a **Treasure Builders Pass (BPass)** first.&#x20;

### **How it works**

The **BPass** is your passport and first step towards entry into the **GBP**. It contains five Integration Areas that will help supercharge games building with Treasure! Teams will receive a **BPass Badge** for each Integration Area satisfied. **Specific BPass Badges** must be maintained for each Tier of the **GBP** as ‘proof of alignment’ with the broader ecosystem.

**Game developers must apply** via the application form to obtain their BPass Badges. Thereafter, periodic reviews starting monthly, will be performed to ensure continued alignment.

**Important:** Treasure views interoperability in gaming as a powerful, untapped design space. However, it is still nascent and largely unproven. Noting this, Treasure’s initial focus is on exploration, education and enablement to help push the industry to discover what could be. A home for ‘all things interoperability’ at Treasure is currently being developed. More details to follow.
