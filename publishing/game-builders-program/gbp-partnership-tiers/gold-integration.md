# Gold Integration

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Treasure\_Tier\_Badge\_Gold\_AW\_100px.png)\
\
Games in the Gold tier will have access to Treasure’s exceptional support and suite of products, including an exclusive discord for ecosystem builders and creators to collaborate. The Arbitrum team will also assist in technical areas and marketing.

Games can also earn rewards for being top performers against Treasure ecosystem priorities. The framework has been designed to encourage, align and reward actions that strategically improve the ecosystem and its participants.
