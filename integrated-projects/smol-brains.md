# Smol Brains

## Overview

Smol Brains NFT was started by John Patten, founder of Treasure NFT. Here's how it works. You start with 2 monkeys and a piece of land. You are able to stake your monkeys to earn IQ. Collective IQ is rebasing. The more IQ that is staked, the faster the monkeys breed and the bigger brained their children. The bigger brain the monkey society, the more opportunities available to individual monkeys, such as building on their land or even going to space!
