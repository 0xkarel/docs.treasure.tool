## Mechanics

The owner of a Life NFT begins with a newborn wrapped in swaddling cloth. At pre-determined intervals, the baby grows — first into a child, then a teenager, an adult, and an elderly person.

Through the evolution, the individual will display new traits and undergo age-related changes. They will go to school, fall in love, take an occupation, experience many triumphs and disappointments unique to their life, and finally, pass away.

Life is a long experiential board game. It is meant to be an emotional experience. The NFTs breed like people, not hamsters. Their lifespans are finite but non-trivial, like our own.

The owner of the NFT will be responsible for choosing the direction of the individual’s life. Transferring the NFT to another wallet would “reset” the individual back to a newborn, its life erased.

Life NFTs are not merely collectibles. They will be the first NFT designed to simulate living, as an on-chain experience.

At death, the owner will receive a commemorative NFT of the person that they shepherded through the world.
