# About Integrated Projects

## What are integrated projects?

Integrated projects are formalized partnerships with Treasure which are leveraging $MAGIC as its resource.&#x20;

They are our way of storing lore of other metaverses and propagating our resource model within said metaverses.

This further encapsulates the idea of extrinsically composable and intrinsically modular resource model. An economic model shared across the Metaverse.&#x20;

## What about external projects?

External projects are currently being built by the community within the Treasure ecosystem but which have not yet been integrated. These projects still need to go through the due process to become listed on the the Treasure Marketplace.
